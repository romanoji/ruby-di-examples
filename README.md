# Ruby DI examples

Simple DI examples in Ruby based on `dry-container`, `dry-auto_inject` & `dry-system` libs.

# What's inside?
- `di.rb` file contains basic usage of the above libs.

- `src/example_1..3` dirs contain DI examples, which shows usage of the libs.

- `src/usage_1..2` dirs contain potential examples, where these DI libs could be used.

# How to run it?

First run `bundle install` to install all required dependencies.

Then:
- `ruby di.rb` - to run basic examples

- `EXAMPLE=1` OR `EXAMPLE=2 ruby run.rb` - to run examples from the respective directories.
